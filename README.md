<h2 align="center">Repository: PacMen Factory</h2>

### Project Title: PacMen Factory

### Description of Project 
##### This exercise allows the user to add multiple PacMen to the screen. By clicking start, all PacMen move around the screen at their own speed. When a PacMen encounters the edge of the screen, it will automatically change direction. All PacMen are stored in an array and the project dynamically add PacMen to the DOM (Document Object Model).

### How to run this project.
##### You can fork this repo to your GitHub account. You can copy and download the repo to your PC by clicking on the green code button and selecting Download ZIP or you can run the project from the landing or project page.

### Roadmap of future improvements: 
##### I would like to add different color Pacmen. I would like to change the background to look like a PacMen board. I would like to add additional edge detection to make PacMen look like the old game from days past.
